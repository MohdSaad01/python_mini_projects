# ☕ Coffee Machine OOP

This is a simple object-oriented Python project that simulates a coffee vending machine. The program allows users to choose from a menu of drinks, checks resource availability, processes payments, and serves coffee — all while following clean modular design principles.

## ☕ Features
- Choose from 3 drinks: espresso, latte, cappuccino
- Reports available resources and earnings
- Checks for sufficient ingredients before making a drink
- Simulates coin-based payments
