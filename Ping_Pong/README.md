# Ping Pong Game 🎮

This is a simple yet classic Ping Pong game built using **Python**. The project is organized into multiple modules (`main.py`, `ball.py`, `paddle.py`, `score.py`) for better readability, maintainability, and modular design.

---

## 🧩 Modules

- `main.py` – Entry point of the game.
- `ball.py` – Handles ball movement, collision detection, and bouncing logic.
- `paddle.py` – Controls paddle movement and input.
- `score.py` – Displays and updates the score.

---
## ⚠️ Important

You **must** download or clone **all the modules** (`main.py`, `ball.py`, `paddle.py`, `score.py`) for the game to work properly.

After downloading or cloning, **run the `main.py` file** to start the game.
